After completing a fellowship in Functional and Epilepsy Surgery at Emory University, I returned to Western University as an Assistant Professor of Neurosurgery.\nLab website coming soon here.\nI am also an Associate Scientist of the Robarts Research Institute, and Associate Member of the School for Biomedical Engineering and Graduate Program in Neuroscience at Western University.\nI was inspired by the aesthetics and simplicity of the Poldrack website and have borrowed from it here for this initial website implementation. I am similarly working on updating an online lab manual that outlines our polices and standard operating procedures, as well as my mentoring philosophy."
