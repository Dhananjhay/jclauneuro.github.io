I’m also deeply interested in improving the way that science is done, by providing researchers with tools and knowledge to help them do research that is more reproducible and more transparent.\nI received my BA in Computer Science from the University of Waterloo and my PhD from Western University where I also completed my training in neurosurgery. After completing a fellowship at Emory University, I returned to Western University. You can learn more about the work that my lab does from our lab web site, Coming Soon. We also have an online lab manual that outlines our polices and standard operating procedures, as well as my mentoring philosophy.\nI am also an Associate Scientist of the Robarts Research Institute, and Associate Member of the School for Biomedical Engineering and Graduate Program in Neuroscience at Western University."
