## About me

I'm a neurosurgeon and researcher using brain imaging to improve the diagnosis and treatment options for patients suffering from neurological disorders.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of Waterloo, my MD degree at Queen's University, and completed my neurosurgical training and PhD from Western University.  After completing a fellowship in Functional and Epilepsy Surgery at Emory University, I returned to Western University as an Assistant Professor of Neurosurgery.

Lab website coming soon [here](https://www.jclauneuro.ca).

I am also an Associate Scientist of the Robarts Research Institute, and Associate Member of the School for Biomedical Engineering and Graduate Program in Neuroscience at Western University. 

I was inspired by the aesthetics and simplicity of the [Poldrack website](https://poldrack.github.io) and have borrowed from it here for this initial website implementation. I am similarly working on updating an [online lab manual](https://poldracklab.github.io) that outlines our polices and standard operating procedures, as well as my mentoring philosophy.
