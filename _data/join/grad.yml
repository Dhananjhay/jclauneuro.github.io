# blurb: "We have openings for students at the <strong>Master's</strong>
#         and <strong>PhD</strong> level. Our current students come from a 
#         diversity of areas that include computer science, engineering, 
#         neuroscience, physics, and medicine to name a few.  We are a 
#         multi-disciplinary lab, however, students with proven skills in 
#         <strong>programming</strong> and <strong>scientific 
#         computing</strong> will be at an advantage.  All students will 
#         also be mentored by clinical collaborators relevant to their 
#         thesis project. Western University provides a 
#         rich and diverse environment for trainees, and I supervise 
#         students in the Department of Medical Biophysics, 
#         Biomedical Engineering and the Neuroscience graduate program. 
#         I encourage you to apply directly to the University as soon as 
#         possible if you are interested!"
