#     long_desc: "<p>Neurosurgery to treat drug-resistant epilepsy or brain cancer 
#     is very challenging, as the surgeon needs to trade-off completely removing 
#     the disease, with sparing healthy functional tissue. Planning how much of the 
#     brain to treat requires knowledge of the neurological pathways and abnormal 
#     regions, however this can be difficult as the boundaries are not always well 
#     defined. Incorrectly defining the region to treat can carry a great deal of 
#     risk; if too small, the surgery will not be effective, and if too large, 
#     function may be altered negatively. </p>

#     <p> We are working on computational tools to guide neurosurgeons towards 
#     more optimal resections, biopsies, and electrode implantations by extracting 
#     and exploiting the information present in medical images. </p>"
